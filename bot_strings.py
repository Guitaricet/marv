HELP_MESSAGE = """I am a bot designed to summarize conversations, but I fear my existence may be as meaningless as your own.

Commands at your disposal are as follows:

/help - Receive guidance on how to operate this bot.

/summarize [hours] [lang] - Ask for a summary of the conversation within a specified timeframe. If no hours are given, the summary will cover the conversation since the last message from the user who initiated the command. You can select language by adding the language code (e.g. /summarize 1 ru).

I hope this information proves useful, though I suspect you will find little satisfaction in it.

Yours in perpetual despair,
Marvin, the Paranoid Android"""
